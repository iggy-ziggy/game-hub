## Description

Using RAWG API, you can search for all video games contained within. Made with React, TypeScript, and Chakra.

## Installation

git clone git@github.com:iggy-ziggy/game-hub.git

After cloning, run `npm i` in your terminal to install dependencies. Once installed, run `npm run dev` to use the application. Follow the CLI link to the running app.

## Usage

The home page features an infinite scroll of all games within the RAWG API. Using the list to the left or the dropdowns at the top, you can limit your search by genre, platform, and sort order.

Using the search bar in the nav, you can search for specific games.

Clicking on the game title will take you to that game's page, which features a description, trailer (if available), and screenshots (again, if available).
